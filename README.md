This is the first official 'Nill Developers' project we have released.
In this project, we intend to use `Google's Firebase` technology to place the data we receive from the user in the huge Google database. (With `GET` method)
In another part of this project, we fetch this data from the database using the `POST` method.
A very important point about this project is:
No backend language was used and only jsx code.
